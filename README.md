Natural Language Processing
- A project in which I experiment with text-classification, using different models, such as random forest classifier.
- Used to predict a service desk issue code.
- Used in a real life scenario, when working on the helpdesk aspect of an IT Team.

-Takes in reports to label and returns a labelled report with reason codes for each description of an issue
-Best classification accuracy was 80+ %
